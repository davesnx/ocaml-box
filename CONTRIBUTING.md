## Setup your development environment

You need Opam, you can install it by following [Opam's documentation](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html).

With Opam installed, you can install the dependencies with:

```bash
# If it's the first time, `make create-switch`
make dev
```

Then, build the project with:

```bash
make build
```

### Running Binary

After building the project, you can run the main binary that is produced.

```bash
make start
```

### Running Tests

You can run the test compiled executable:

```bash
make test
```

### Building documentation

Documentation for the libraries in the project can be generated with:

```bash
make doc
open-cli $(make doc-path)
```

This assumes you have a command like [open-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/open-cli) installed on your system.

> NOTE: On macOS, you can use the system command `open`, for instance `open $(make doc-path)`

### Releasing

To create a release and publish it on Opam, first update the `CHANGES.md` file with the last changes and the version that you want to release.
The, you can run the script `script/release.sh`. The script will perform the following actions:

- Create a tag with the version found in `ocaml-box.opam`, and push it to your repository.
- Create the distribution archive.
- Publish the distribution archive to a Github Release.
- Submit a PR on Opam's repository.

When the release is published on Github, the CI/CD will trigger the `Release` workflow which will perform the following actions

- Compile binaries for all supported platforms.
- Create an NPM release containing the pre-built binaries.
- Publish the NPM release to the registry.
